We do not knowingly collect information from or provide services to individuals outside the United States, including Europe or other countries beyond U.S. borders. If you are accessing the Service from outside the U.S., please do not use the Service, as it is not intended for you.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Collect Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Directly from You</strong>: Through account registration, video uploads, and interactions with the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatically</strong>: Via cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies when you access the Service, including IP address and location data.</li>
        <li><strong>From Third Parties</strong>: We use Supabase for data storage, which may involve their collection of technical information necessary for hosting.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To create and manage your user account.</li>
        <li>To store and provide access to your recorded videos.</li>
        <li>To improve the Service, including analytics and performance optimization.</li>
        <li>For business purposes, such as delivering targeted advertisements based on your IP address and general location.</li>
        <li>To communicate with you, including service updates, notifications, and support.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations or protect our rights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. However, we may share information with service providers like Supabase for storage and hosting purposes. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only as directed by us.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information, including videos and account data, for as long as your account remains active. If you delete your account, we will delete your data within a reasonable timeframe, except where retention is required by law (e.g., for tax or legal compliance).</p>
    
    <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Opt-Out of Ads</strong>: You may opt out of targeted advertising by adjusting your browser or device settings, though this may not fully prevent data collection for other purposes.</li>
